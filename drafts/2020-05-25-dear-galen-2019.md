# Dear Galen,

I'm writing this letter a little further into 2019 than I had planned. Last year was a doozy and it's rolled over into this year a little bit. Convincing myself to write this series seemed like a no-brainer at first, but sitting down and being honest about the past year took more effort than I expected. I learned a lot. The lessons I learned were major ones too. When you read this, I don't expect you to have mastered them. I just hope you haven't forgotten and that you'll continue to work on them. It might take a lifetime and that's okay. But not everything that happened this year was so serious - there were a lot of good times and a lot of hard work. You accomplished a lot to be proud of.

## What Happened

In the category of major events, being hired at Google was 2019's headline.

  - Low friction environment is surprisingly high friction
  - Mathematics of desirable women

## What I Learned

- Work
  - how i think of my strengths and how i enjoy working
    - probably belong in a startup environment if i want to get ahead by just simply working harder/smarter
    - it seems like on my current trajectory, i'm basically valuable because of my ability to deal with people and that is a reframing of my identity that i need to consider
      - there's a lot of virtue in my work as it is
  - so much of my identity is wrapped up in work
    - im looking to invest more in relationships and other passions so its not so all or nothing
    - part of me is freaked out that i could become satisfied or complacent and just stay in golden handcuffs.
      - i really want to break out of the norm and do some buck wild shit and be my own boss. 
  - im not cut out for corporate life
    - if there was a place i could do it, it would be google
      - too bad google's fundamental business model is shit for the world
        - i degoogled and started using brave because of this. really worked up about how fucked the attention economy. reference Lanier. 

- Goals
  - i'm trying to slow down and think in longer terms, it's hard
    - MBA, buying property or moving by my family, grad school in europe, taking a gap year, USDS or 18F - all of these things are several years at a time
  - dopamine flushing and the competition for reward
  - i 100% feel like i am waiting for a destination instead of enjoying the journey
    - college was a fucking blunder
    - getting into debt was a fucking blunder
    - i am proud that i've made the best of it and im clawing my way out of this pit of bullshit, but i dont want to delay my satisfaction with life until im free of it
      - i can start making art now (what comes next)
  - gained a bunch of weight at google. gotta watch what i eat. gotta exercise. gotta get good sleep.
    - i can feel my age for the first time. im coasting downhill. 
  - i've kept up therapy
    - it's cool. some sessions are more productive than others. im becoming more aware of my emotions.

## Reflecting On My 2018 Letter

## What Comes Next

MBA program
  in-person
  work pays
  hopefully meet some people and build the network
Bust ass at work and pay off the loans
  USDS, 18F
  year off to read, cycletrek, ride on tankers
Create some generative art
  tensorflow certificate
  mess around with GANs
  play with Ableton


Sincerely,  
Galen
