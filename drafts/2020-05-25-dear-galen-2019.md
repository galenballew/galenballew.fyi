Dear Galen,

I'm writing this letter a little further into 2019 than I had planned. Last year was a doozy and it's rolled over into this year a little bit. Convincing myself to write this series seemed like a no-brainer at first, but sitting down and being honest about the past year took more effort than I expected. I learned a lot. The lessons I learned were major ones too. When you read this, I don't expect you to have mastered them. I just hope you haven't forgotten and that you'll continue to work on them. It might take a lifetime and that's okay. But not everything that happened this year was so serious - there were a lot of good times and a lot of hard work. You accomplished a lot to be proud of.
