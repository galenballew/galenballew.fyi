**Notes:**
- the site is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch
- there is no CI/CD that integrates changes to `master`/`gh-pages`
  - pushing to `master` and deploying are two discrete steps
- to deploy, run `npm run deploy` from inside the root directory
  - check `package.json` to see the contents of the `deploy` script
