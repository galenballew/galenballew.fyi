I was hired to work for a phenomenal manager, Aaron Hanlon, within Google Cloud's Professional Services Organization as a Technical Account Manager. Then, in August, I moved into an apartment with three great roommates (one of them being Winnie the dog!) My idea was to save money and I definitely managed to do that - my rent went from $1,500 to $650. It ended up being a really great move because I was hardly ever at home due to traveling for work. The downside of my super low rent was that my bedroom was just barely big enough for my bed. I was never really able to unpack or get comfortable. I ended up subletting and moving into another 1BR apartment in West Loop in February 2020.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In October, Izzy passed away. All three of the dogs I grew up with are gone now.

In December, we had a chance for both families to meet and enjoy a wonderful dinner at the Kirsch home. Everyone got along and we had a great time together.

Developing focus has been tough for me and I expect it to be a work-in-progress for some time. The most concrete focus that I've laid out for myself has been to develop my reading and fitness habits. I gained about 20 pounds at Google thanks to poor habits, stress, and travel (and the food is really good... \\uD83D\\uDE05) I didn't pick fitness just as a tactical band-aid though.
