I had done some programming and school and I loved it, but I wasn\\u2019t competitive with computer science or engineering students. I wanted to take the next step and program as a career, but I needed to do it quickly before my student loans kicked in. I started looking into bootcamps to jump-start my career.\\nTech bootcamps are everywhere. They\\u2019re in every major city and they\\u2019re for all different roles in the technology sector. Most of them are for front-end web development, but I chose to pursue data science. In April, I graduated from Metis after 12 weeks of intensive data science training. I had to put in a significant chunk of cash, as well as a lot of hard work, but I got a lot back in return.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"What can a bootcamp do for you?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Right now, most bootcamps are for front-end web development, but there are a variety of different types. The open-floor office space that Metis\\u2019 Chicago campus operates in is shared with Dev Bootcamp. I got to learn the ins and outs of more than one kind of bootcamp while at Metis. For the sake of this article, I\\u2019m going to speak strictly about my personal experience, but many bootcamps share common themes or structure because the people who run them look at other, successful bootcamps for examples.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The point of bootcamps is to get you a job. This does not mean that you are going to become a master at your craft in 12 weeks. In fact, when you graduate is when the real learning begins. During the bootcamp you will find out exactly how much you don\\u2019t know and from there you can start the long journey of continuing to learn, skill up, and practice.

For starters, it\\u2019s 12 weeks long, 5 days a week, 9 hours per day. That doesn\\u2019t include the time you work outside of class. Bootcamps will use the word immersive\\u200A\\u2014\\u200Athis is exactly what they mean. During the 12 weeks, I built 5 machine learning projects that used real-world data, I also created a blog to showcase some of them, and made sure my GitHub was up to snuff. On top of that, I practiced coding, problem solving, and presentation skills with my classmates every single day. Bootcamps revolve around the idea of lecturing on a topic and then immediately putting it to action. There is so much to learn and so little time, you need to get your hands dirty in order for things to stick.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Outside of the classroom, I attended at least one event every week.

We also spent a lot of time doing mock interviews (technical and otherwise) which proved to be invaluable.
