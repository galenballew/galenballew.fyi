It is simply running your existing legacy app on cloud infrastructure. Most rehosting can be done using automated tools, however a manual migration can be useful to learn how to apply the workload in the new cloud environment. Additionally, applications are often easier to optimize or re-architect once they are already running in the cloud. This party because of people, talent, and process and also partly because migration of the application, data, and traffic is already done (the hard part). \"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"2.
