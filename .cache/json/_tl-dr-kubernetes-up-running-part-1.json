Immutability is the practice of replacing the current image with a brand new one, rather than updating it incrementally. The advantage of this approach is that there is a record of the delta between the images that can be used to troubleshoot any errors. Furthermore, you can rollback to the previous image if the new one doesn't work - this is much more difficult if you are applying incremental changes to the same image. This ties directly into the concept of declarative configuration. Kubernetes itself manages changes to its state in a declarative fashion - each new desired state is declared concretely. Changes are not implied imperatively. Finally, Kubernetes manages this declared state continuously. If the actual state is different from the desired state, k8s will take action to create the desired state. All of these concepts add up to less time spent on operations and debugging, and more time developing new features.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Kubernetes achieves scaling for both applications and teams via decoupled architecture. By isolating all components of a distributed system via APIs and load balancers, each system may scale independently. APIs result in a crisp surface area between components. Teams can stay relatively small (and therefore agile) and have ownership of their microservice without having to coordinate with other teams - everyone can refer to the API schema. Additionally, clusters are able to add and remove machines very easily. This allows for low lead times on additional compute substrate, allowing applications to scale as needed, but it also means that a small operations team can support many clusters and many more development teams. This idea of fungible machines within a cluster ties directly into abstracted infrastructure.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Because k8s treats all machines as fungible, it allows for portability of Kubernetes APIs between IaaS providers (i.e., public cloud) and data centers. There are specific \\\"gotchas\\\" if you are using vendor managed services (e.g., AWS DynamoDB), but for the most part, Kubernetes is able to abstract components like load balancers and storage within different clouds. \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Bonus material:\"), \" although not in this book, \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/\"\n  }), \"GCP Anthos\"), \" takes this idea one step further. Anthos provides a single pane of glass to manage a Kubernetes cluster or clusters that can span multiple clouds as well as on-prem. This gives companies a highly abstracted viewpoint for application development and operations. It also gives the business a clear road map for cloud migration, multi-cloud HA/DR capabilities, and more.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Lastly, k8s achieves efficiency by colocating applications on the same machine without impacting the applications themselves. This means that more work can be done by fewer machines. This results in direct economic benefits, but also allows for new development methodologies. Rather than scaling testing environments at the VM level, a single cluster can support the entire testing environment. This makes it possible to test every single commit or pull request, every time, throughout your entire stack.

Piggybacking on this idea, it's important to order your layers according to which layers are most likely to change; these layers should be \\\"at the top\\\" or the newest of all layers. In the example above, if Container A were to change often, Containers B, C, and D would each need to be re-built to incorporate the changes.
