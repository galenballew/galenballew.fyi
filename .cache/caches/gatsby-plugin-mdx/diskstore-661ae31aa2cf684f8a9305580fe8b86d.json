The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`DaemonSet`}</inlineCode>{` is distinctly different in that it it places a Pod onto every node in the cluster (or a subset of nodes). The Pods managed by a DaemonSet are usually landing some sort of agent or daemon onto the node. They are not traditional serving applications (like ReplicaSet Pods), but instead augment the capabilities of the cluster itself. By defining DaemonSets in declarative configuration, we can be sure that Pods are running on all of the proper nodes, even in an autoscaling cluster where nodes from and go freely.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Which nodes a DaemonSet runs on in a cluster is defined in the DaemonSet spec using labels. It's possible to select a subset of nodes. Common use cases for this are selecting nodes with certain hardware (e.g., GPUs or SSDs). In order to do this, nodes must be properly labeled. Here is an example command to label a node: `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl label nodes galens-awesome-node-123 gpu=true`}</inlineCode>{`. This label can now be specified in the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`NodeSelector`}</inlineCode>{` field of the DaemonSet spec. Because DaemonSets manage Pods using a reconciliation loop, if any required labels are removed from a node, the DaemonSet Pods will also be removed. Similar to a ReplicaSet, if a DaemonSet is deleted, its Pods will be deleted as well unless you are using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--cascade=false`}</inlineCode>{`.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Prior to Kubernetes version 1.6, updating DaemonSets required updating the declarative configuration for the the DaemonSet and then performing a rolling delete of each Pod, or deleting the entire DaemonSet and redeploying. While the latter is much simpler, the drawback is downtime. A rolling delete/update can be performed using the following code snippet:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-bash\"\n      }}>{`PODS=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath -template='{.items[*]metadata.name}')\nfor x in $PODS; do\n  kubectl delete pods \\${x}\n  sleep 60 #delete one pod every 60 seconds\ndone\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`delete`}</inlineCode>{` method is still the default update strategy for DaemonSets in order to support backwards compatibility. However, newer versions of Kubernetes now support a rolling update strategy similar to Deployments. You will need to configure `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`spec.updateStrategy.type`}</inlineCode>{` field of the DaemonSet to have the value `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`RollingUpdate`}</inlineCode>{`. Any changes to the DaemonSet `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`spec.template`}</inlineCode>{` field or subfields will trigger a rolling update. Rolling updates come with two additional parameters:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`spec.minReadySeconds`}</inlineCode>{`, determines how long a Pod's status must be \"ready\" before moving onto the next Pod  `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable`}</inlineCode>{`, how many Pods can be being updated simultaneously`}<br parentName=\"li\"></br>\n        {`It's best practice to set `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`spec.minReadySeconds`}</inlineCode>{` to something like 30-60 seconds to ensure that Pods are truly healthy before proceeding. Setting `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable`}</inlineCode>{` to 1 is the safest value, but depending on the size of the application and cluster, can result in long rollouts. Increasing the value increases the blast radius for a failed rollout. It's best practice to set the value low and only increase it if users or admins complain about rollout speed.  `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Chapter 10: Jobs`}</h2>\n    <p><inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Jobs`}</inlineCode>{` are used to run short-lived, one-off tasks. They create and manage Pods that run until successful termination (i.e., exit with 0). If a Pod fails before successful termination, the Job controller will create another one from the Pod template in the Job spec. When a Job completes, the Job and related Pod are still around. You will need to provide the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`-a`}</inlineCode>{` flag in `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubectl`}</inlineCode>{` to see completed Jobs. Jobs can be created both imperatively and declaratively. Both options will use the parameter/field `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`restartPolicy`}</inlineCode>{`. It is recommended to use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`restartPolicy=OnFailure`}</inlineCode>{` so that Pods are recreated in place. Using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`restartPolicy=Never`}</inlineCode>{` will create an entirely new Pod after each failure and can lead to a lot of \"junk\". It's not uncommon for a bug to cause a Pod to crash as soon as it starts. This behavior is monitored by `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubelet`}</inlineCode>{` on the node and will set the Pod status to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`CrashLoopBackOff`}</inlineCode>{` without the Job controller doing anything. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`CrashLoopBackOff`}</inlineCode>{` delays the Pod from being recreated to avoid eating resources on the node. Pods can also appear healthy, but be deadlocked. Jobs support liveness probes to determine Pod health in these situations.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jobs have 2 major parameters that control their behavior, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`completions`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`parallelism`}</inlineCode>{`. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`parallelism`}</inlineCode>{` determines how many copies of a Pods to spin up at once. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`completions`}</inlineCode>{` determines the number of successful exits before a Job stops running. If `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`completions`}</inlineCode>{` is left unset, the Job will be put into a worker pool mode. Once the first Pod exits successfully, the Job will start winding down and not add any new Pods. This means that none of the workers should exit until the work is done and they are all in the process of finishing up.  `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Chapter 11: ConfigMaps and Secrets`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We want to make our container images as reusable and portable as possible. In order to do this, we need to be able to configure them at runtime so that the application runs properly according to its environment.
