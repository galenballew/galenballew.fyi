This is to avoid confusion with the common term of service. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Constant width`}</inlineCode>{` formatting is typically reserved for program elements, such as k8s API objects, parameters, or processes. `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Chapter 5: Pods`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Pods represent a collection of application containers and volumes running in the same execution environment. Pods are the most atomic object within Kubernetes, therefore all containers within a Pod will always land on the same node within a cluster. Each container runs in its own `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`cgroup`}</inlineCode>{` and we will leverage that using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`requests`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`limits`}</inlineCode>{` later on in this chapter. All applications running in a Pod share the same hostname, IP address and port space. Containers within a Pod can communicate with one another, but are isolated from containers in other Pods. Since a Pod can be composed of multiple containers, it's natural to ask which containers should be included in any given Pod. The question to ask yourself is `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`\"Will these containers work correctly if they land on separate machines?\"`}</em>{` If the answer is \"no\", then the containers should be placed in the same Pod. As we will see, it's often the case that containers within the same Pod interact via a shared volume that is also within the Pod.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Pods are managed via YAML or JSON templates known as a Pod manifest. These manifests are text-file representations of the k8s API object. They are sent to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`kube-apiserver`}</inlineCode></a>{`, which in turn passes them to the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`kube-scheduler`}</inlineCode></a>{`. The scheduler then places the Pod onto a node that has sufficient resources. A daemon on the node, named `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`kubelet`}</inlineCode></a>{`, creates the containers declared in the Pod manifest and performs any health checks. Once a Pod as been scheduled to a node, there is no rescheduling if the node fails. The Kubernetes scheduler takes this into account and tries to ensure that Pods from the same application are distributed onto different nodes, in order to avoid a single failure domain. Once scheduled, will only change nodes if they are explicitly destroyed and rescheduled.  When a Pod is deleted, it has a termination grace period with a default value of 30 seconds. This grace period allows the Pod to finish serving any active requests that it is processing before terminating. Any data stored within the containers on the Pod will be lost when the Pod terminates. The `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`PersistentVolume`}</inlineCode>{` object can be used to store data across multiple instances of Pod and their subsequent lifespans.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Once a Pod is running, you may want to access it even if it is not serving traffic on the Internet. You can use `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/\"\n      }}>{`port forwarding`}</a>{` to create a secure tunnel from your local machine, through the Kubernetes master, to the instance of the Pod running on a worker node.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`There are several types of health checks for containers within Kubernetes. The first is a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`process health check`}</em>{`. This health check simply checks if the main process of your application is running. If it isn't, Kubernetes restarts it. This health check is automatic and does not need to be defined. A simple process check is often insufficient however. Imagine that your process is deadlocked - the health check will be green, but your application will be red. To address this, Kubernetes supports `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`liveness health checks.`}</em>{` Liveness health checks are defined within the Pod manifest per container and each container is health checked separately. They run application-specific logic to ensure that the application is not only running, but functioning properly. Lastly, there are `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`readiness health checks.`}</em>{` These checks are configured similarly to liveness probes. The difference is that containers which fail a liveness health check are restarted while containers that file a readiness probe are removed from Service load balancers. Combining liveness and readiness probes ensures that all traffic is routed to healthy containers that have capacity to fulfill the request. Kubernetes also supports `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`tcpSocket`}</inlineCode>{` health checks, which are useful for databases r other non-HTTP-based APIs. Finally, k8s supports `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`exec`}</inlineCode>{` probes. These execute a script in the context of a container - if the script returns zero, the probe succeeds. These are useful for applications where validation logic doesn't fit neatly into an HTTP request.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`One of the most powerful features of Pods is the ability to define the minimum and maximum compute resources available for the containers within the Pod. By rightsizing container requirements, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kube-scheduler`}</inlineCode>{` is able to efficiently pack Pods onto nodes, thereby driving up utilization. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Requests`}</em>{` specify the minimum resources needed by a Pod in order to be scheduled - `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`limits`}</em>{` specify the maximum resources a container may use. Both are declared at the container level within the Pod manifest. It's worth mentioning that memory (unlike CPU) cannot be redistributed if it has already been allocated to a container process. Therefore, when the system runs out of memory, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubelet`}</inlineCode>{` terminates containers whose memory usage is greater than their requested amount.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Volumes are used for containers within a Pod to share some kind of state information. They can be used to communicate, synchronize, cache, or even persist state data beyond the lifespan of the Pod itself. Volumes are declared within the Pod manifest and container declarations may include `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`volumeMounts`}</inlineCode>{`. It's important to note that containers can mount the same volume to different paths. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`emptyDir`}</inlineCode>{` volumes can be used to create a shared filesystem between containers. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`hostDir`}</inlineCode>{` volumes can grant access to the underlying host filesystem. There are multiple supported protocols for remote network storage volumes that can be used for truly persistent data, including NFS, iSCSI, and cloud network storage like AWS EBS, Azure FDS, and GCP Persistent Disk.  `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Chapter 6: Labels and Annotations`}</h2>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Labels`}</em>{` and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`annotations`}</em>{` are types of metadata about Kubernetes API objects. They each serve a different purpose. Labels are used to `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`identify`}</strong>{` and `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`select`}</strong>{` sets of objects, while annotations are designed to hold nonidentifying information that can be leveraged by tools and libraries.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Kubernetes uses labels to group and select objects. There are a variety of ways to express the selection logic:  `}</p>\n    <table>\n      <thead parentName=\"table\">\n        <tr parentName=\"thead\">\n          <th parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><strong parentName=\"th\">{`Operator`}</strong></th>\n          <th parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><strong parentName=\"th\">{`Description`}</strong></th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody parentName=\"table\">\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key=value`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key`}</inlineCode>{` is set to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value`}</inlineCode></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key!=value`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key`}</inlineCode>{` is not set to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value`}</inlineCode></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key in (value1, value2)`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key`}</inlineCode>{` is one of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value1`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value2`}</inlineCode></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key notin (value1, value2)`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key`}</inlineCode>{` is not one of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value1`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`value2`}</inlineCode></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`key`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}>{`key is set`}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr parentName=\"tbody\">\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}><inlineCode parentName=\"td\">{`!key`}</inlineCode></td>\n          <td parentName=\"tr\" {...{\n            \"align\": \"center\"\n          }}>{`key is not set`}</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>{`You can use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubectl`}</inlineCode>{` and labels to find and manage objects.

Usually, a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Service`}</inlineCode>{` uses a named label selector to identify the Pods, but it is also possible to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service\"\n      }}>{`define a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`Service`}</inlineCode>{` without selectors`}</a>{`. By default, when a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Service`}</inlineCode>{` is created, k8s assigns it a virtual IP called a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`cluster IP`}</em>{`. The cluster IP load-balances across the selected Pods. It also has a DNS name within `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kube-dns`}</inlineCode>{`.

This means that if you can reach any node in the cluster, you can contact a service without knowing where that service is running. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`LoadBalancer`}</inlineCode>{` builds upon `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`NodePort`}</inlineCode>{`. It integrates with cloud providers to provision a new load balancer and direct it at the nodes in your cluster, resulting in an IP or hostname depending on the cloud provider. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Bonus material:`}</strong>{` there is also `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types\"\n      }}><inlineCode parentName=\"a\">{`ExternalName`}</inlineCode></a>{` if your cluster is running CoreDNS v1.7 or higher.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`For every `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Service`}</inlineCode>{` object, Kubernetes creates an `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Endpoints`}</inlineCode>{` object which contains the IP addresses for that service.

By talking directly the k8s API, you can retrieve and call service endpoints. Kubernetes can also \"watch\" objects and be notified when they change, including the IPs associated with a service. Most applications are not written to be Kubernetes-native and therefore don't leverage this, but it's important to know that it's possible.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Regardless of the type, all `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Service`}</inlineCode>{` objects will load-balance.

This allows the ReplicaSet to create a new, healthy Pod and the sick Pod is now quarantined. Developers can actively investigate the Pod in order to debug, rather than having only logs to sort through.  `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Sometimes you may wonder which ReplicaSet is managing a Pod. This kind of discovery is enabled by the ReplicaSet creating an annotation on every Pod it creates. The annotation key is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubernetes.io/created-by`}</inlineCode>{`. This annotation is best-effort and only created when the Pod is created by the ReplicaSet - a user can remove the annotation at any time. If you are otherwise interesting in finding the Pods managed by a particular ReplicaSet, you can perform `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl get pods -l <key1=value1>,<key2=value2>`}</inlineCode>{`, where the labels are defined in the ReplicaSet spec. This is exactly the same API call that the ReplicaSet itself uses to find and manage its set of Pods.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`ReplicaSets support imperative scaling via `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl scale <replica-set-name> --replicas=4`}</inlineCode>{` for example. However, this is a stop gap measure to be sure. All declarative text-file configurations should be updated ASAP to reflect any imperative changes. This is to avoid a situation where the current state is dramatically different from a new, desired state being applied from a text-file configuration. Kubernetes also supports `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`horizontal pod autoscaling`}</em>{` (HPA). This is distinctly different from vertical pod autoscaling (giving Pods greater resource requests and limits) and cluster autoscaling (adding more worker nodes to the cluster). HPA requires the presence of the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`heapster`}</inlineCode>{` Pod on your cluster, which included in most k8s installations by default and runs in the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kube-system`}</inlineCode>{` namespace. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`heapster`}</inlineCode>{` keeps track of resource consumption metrics and provides an API to use when making autoscaling decisions. HPA is a separate k8s object from ReplicaSets and thus is loosely coupled. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`It is a bad idea to combine autoscaling with imperative or declarative management of the number of replicas.`}</strong>{` If you are using HPA, just manage the HPA object itself. Interfering with it could result in unexpected behavior.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`By default, when you delete a ReplicaSet, you delete the Pods it is managing. You can avoid this by setting `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--cascade=false`}</inlineCode>{` in your command - e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl delete rs galens-rs --cascade=false`}</inlineCode>{`.  `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h1>{`Resources:`}</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><em parentName=\"li\">{`Kubernetes Up & Running`}</em>{` `}<a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running\"\n        }}>{`GitHub repository`}</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h1>{`Continue Reading`}</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`[Part 1]`}{`({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-09-08-kuar-part1.md %})`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`[Part 2]`}{`({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-09-09-kuar-part2.md %})`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`[Part 3]`}{`({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-09-12-kuar-part3.md %})`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`[Part 4]`}{`({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-09-15-kuar-part4.md %})`}</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
