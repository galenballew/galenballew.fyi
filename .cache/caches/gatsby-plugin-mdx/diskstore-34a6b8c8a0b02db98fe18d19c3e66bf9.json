The note exists and it even contains some text; the backlink to the note that originally linked to it. However, we need a little more than that. If I want my new note to appear as an article of sorts on my blog with minimal effort, I need a little more boilerplate text added than just the title of the note and a backlink. At minimum, we'd need to add the Markdown header (if you're using a Markdown based website.)
