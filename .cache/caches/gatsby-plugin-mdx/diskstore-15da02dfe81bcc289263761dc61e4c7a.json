We had not taken a family vacation in `}<em parentName=\"p\"><strong parentName=\"em\">{`years and years`}</strong></em>{`. Spending that kind of time together under one roof was really special. It's probably the last time that we will ever be together just us. I could not have asked for a better trip.  `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h3>{`What I Learned`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Working at Google was one of the coolest experiences I've ever been a part of. Now, granted, there's a lot of ego that gets fired up when a prestigious institution and the most trusted brand in America invites you to join them. I definitely took a sip or two of Google Kool-Aid and felt my identity getting tied up in work. But `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`beyond that`}</em>{`, Google is an inspiring example of how workplaces can function `}<em parentName=\"p\"><strong parentName=\"em\">{`at scale`}</strong></em>{`. It's seriously mind blowing to consider it. On one hand, it's clear that the culture spawns all sorts of amazing projects, creativity, great work/life balance, and any number of other phenomenal outcomes. On the other hand, everything is built upon a foundation of information tracking, attention economics, and incentives and practices that I fundamentally disagree with. It's a complex issue. Having a chance to witness it firsthand only made it more complex. While I would be excited to work at Google again, I also have begun the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://hey.com/\"\n      }}>{`process`}</a>{` of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://brave.com/\"\n      }}>{`de-Googling`}</a>{` my `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://duckduckgo.com/\"\n      }}>{`life`}</a>{`.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`I learned so much at Google - it's hard to bundle it all up into a letter. It could be it's own article, but I'm not interested in being trite. However, I will say that the people are fantastic; I met so many smart, ambitious, curious people. I had an amazing manager who not only encouraged and empowered me, but he had actually wrote the playbook for how to be successful at Google by `}<strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`creating value`}</em></strong>{`. This is what I took away from Google. It was my lightbulb moment. I was just starting to build some momentum along this vector on my way out, but I'm still working on it at TransUnion.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Here's the \"secret recipe\":  `}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Be `}<em parentName=\"li\">{`excellent`}</em>{` at your current responsibilities.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Advocate for your vision and prove it out to the best of your abilities, while maintaining #1.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Time #2 correctly.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`Now, I don't think this is earth shattering information, but to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`internalize`}</em>{` it was a big deal. At Google, #2 can feel tough because no one is telling you what to get involved in. There's a million potential projects that you `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`could`}</em>{` get involved in, so trying to either come up with what's missing or identify your golden ticket is tough. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`But that is exactly what is so god damn amazing about Google - you can do almost anything you want!`}</strong>{` Want to pilot a new program? That can happen. Want to work on a certain project? That can happen too. The company is your oyster. For me, this is a particular draw. I have no shortage of ideas and I usually have a strong vision for how I think things should be. I try to evolve those ideas as I learn more, but I very much think in the future. Being able to turn those visions into reality is hard, but compelling!    `}</p>\n    <p>{`The catch, especially for me, is that you need a track record of #1. You need to have some street cred so that you have social/political capital to spend. I tend to come in pretty hot, kick a bunch of ass, then get bored. In my mind, I achieve #1 and then I'm immediately ready for #2. I get frustrated when it feels like nothing is changing. Knowing that I have agency over each step of the process has helped me feel less antsy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, there is the elusive #3. I don't have enough experience to say if #3 is a learnable skill or if it's pure instinct - it's probably somewhere inbetween. The idea is that if management hears your great idea and agrees with it, but you're not in a position to spearhead it due to #1, then they might ask another team to take up the initiative. There are some other factors at play and a little additional manuevering, but the point stands that timing is important. I haven't had a personal success of #3 yet, but I've seen its side effect all over. Ever heard about a project that's tried several times to get off the ground? That's a timing issue. `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Outside of work, I spent this year making an effort to widdle things down - my possessions, my goals, my budget. The long road of a career is looming in front of me and my adult(ish) brain is starting to think in longer terms. Not only do I not have enough time in this life to do all the things I would like to, but by trying to do too much at once I actually impede my progress on everything! Developing focus has been tough for me and I expect it to be a work-in-progress for some time. The most concrete focus that I've laid out for myself has been to develop my reading and fitness habits. I gained about 20 pounds at Google thanks to poor habits, stress, and travel (and the food is really good... ðŸ˜…) I didn't pick fitness just as a tactical band-aid though. Along with reading, I think of them as foundational habits that will have huge payoffs as I grow older.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`I had to reduce the number of things I was trying to work on simultaneously because I found my limit. I was studying for professional certifications, taking Greek classes, traveling for work, pushing myself to read, write, exercise, eat clean, cook more, listen to music, etc etc - the list goes on. When I started my Masters in Computer Science, I topped out and recalibrated myself. However, after the fact, I randomly stumbled across a video about `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://youtu.be/eBPsWni-3Fs\"\n      }}>{`dopamine detox`}</a>{`. This was another lightbulb moment that helped me to connect some intuition and commonly heard advice with practical, biophysical activity. The idea is that you cannot treat tackling all your various goals as distinct, separate efforts. They are all connected. This is because they have different scales of dopamine reward involved. If you're trying to build a habit like reading or working out, your brain is not going to \"get its fix\" if you're also playing video games or drinking beers each day. Rewards are relative! There's plenty of things that have a low activation cost and a high global dopamine reward maxima (beer, beer, beer!). If you want to build habits with high activation costs and low global reward maxima, you gotta make dang sure those activites are yielding a `}<strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`local`}</em>{` maxima!`}</strong>{`  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Speaking of reward, I am happy to say that I received an `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`A`}</inlineCode>{` in Artificial Intelligence at UIC in the Masters of Computer Science program. I am also please to annouce that I have since dropped out of the program (shocker, I know) and transferred to the Masters of Business Administration program. I would love to study CS, but what I currently want out of academia at this point in my life is:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`In-person classes`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`The opportunity to meet people my age (sorry freshmen)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`A flexible course schedule that works with my life`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`The MBA program checks all of these boxes and, more than anything, I think it will be a fun experience that is a little outside of my normal bubble!  `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h3>{`Reflecting On My 2018 Letter`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Looking back on my `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://galenballew.fyi/blog/dear-galen-2018/\"\n      }}>{`first letter`}</a>{`, it's crazy to think about how some aspects of my life have changed so dramatically, but others are making slow, steady progress.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I think I've said enough about work, but I did find it hilarious that I said \"work isn't everything\". This past year it's really felt like I live to work, but I am trying to keep track of it. I definitely could have taken a little more time off and skipped going into the office on weekends, but I used up all my PTO going to Costa Rica! Totally worth it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Coming back to TransUnion has been fun (a little weird too since it's been entirely remote). It definitely feels like I am picking up exactly where I left off, which makes me wonder what it was like while I was gone. One thing that has changed quite a bit though is my position as a delegator. I don't know if this is because of my title, because they \"brought me back\" to be part of the team, or just because someone needs to do it and that's me, but it's been an adjustment. Luckily, I am being supported and mentored (Thanks Mike, Mark, and Mark!). I also am surrounded by great engineers, so I couldn't ask for a better opportunity to cut my teeth. That being said, it's a new type of ambiguity, so I am actively trying to triangulate in on exactly what is mine to do and how to do it well.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`My relationship with Chas has improved since we took our trip to Australia 2 years ago (Spring 2018 and I'm writing this June 2020). I think a big part of that is Molly ðŸ˜„ She is great and I feel like Chas is much warmer when she is around. She also asks me about my life and checks in on me, which feels really great and isn't something that Chas actively does. Although, I can't say I check in on Chas myself. Or really anyone in my family. The pandemic has definitely brought us closer together with all of the virtual hangouts and weekly calls, but I've been vocal about how \"I'm doing my own thing\" at this point in my life. It's made me feel bad that everyone is ready to have the entire family settle down in the PNW when I am trying to carve out a few years for myself. I know it's a timing thing and nothing personal, but it's resulted in me putting up a bit of an independent front.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Regarding my finances, I am really proud to say that I have stayed the course. On my current trajectory, I'll have $20k in a rainy day fund this September. It's pretty common advice to have this safety net before focusing on other financial goals and, once again, I'm setting up a bedrock for my future. I've also stuck to my automated budgeting and have not taken on any additional credit card debt. In fact, I've gone one step futher and I've essentially stopped using my credit cards. This has had a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`huge`}</em>{` impact on my spending habits - credit is just `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`way.`}</strong>{` `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`too.`}</strong>{` `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`easy.`}</strong>{` Adding a little friction to my transactions has resulted in being a much more thoughtful consumer - something I am really happy about. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Being impeccable with my word... that's a tough one. In the context of my 2018 letter, I was clearly interested in what I say to other people. With others, even if I botched the delivery, I made an effort to be `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`intentional`}</em>{`. I have not mastered this by any stretch of the imagination. I also have not been \"field tested\" as of yet - my job at Google was relatively solitary and I have not participated in the dating scene. But in the relations I have had, I can honestly say that I have been practing being intentional with my words.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`I think that being impeccable with what I say to myself has been the real mountain to climb this past year. I have not summitted yet. In fact, I didn't even know the mountain was directly in my path! I was in the foothills for years, but had no idea because I was gazing at my feet. Therapy has definitely helped me look up and get the bigger picture (I've kept up with it - yay!) The process of cutting down on my goals and plans has also required introspection. It's becoming more obvious to myself when I am just going through the motions, but I still struggle to find another mode of being at times. Some therapy sessions are more productive than others. These are usually the sessions where I'm honest with myself about something. Other times, it feels much less like a revelation and a lot more like getting cofee with myself. Like I'm getting to know myself and respect/accept everything that I encompass - the good and the bad. The direct conflict between who we are and who we want to be can be a minefield of half-truths if we're not intentional. I am working on being gentle with myself.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Last, but certainly not least, I've pivoted on van life. But it's not what you think; my plans have become even more `}<strong parentName=\"p\"><em parentName=\"strong\">{`radical!`}</em></strong><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`(ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§  `}</p>\n    <h3>{`What Comes Next`}</h3>\n    <p>{`For the first time in a long time, my immediate future is pretty straight forward. It's going to take me until approximately the end of 2022 to pay my student loans off. Until then, I am more or less locked in! I find this both strange and extremely relaxing.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`That being said, there's plenty to ideate about for `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`after`}</em>{` I am debt-free! Like I said, I think that van life is in the scrap yard. After doing a considerable amount of research and really digging into it, it's not exactly what I'm trying to accomplish. If you can believe it, I'd like to do something even more spartan.
