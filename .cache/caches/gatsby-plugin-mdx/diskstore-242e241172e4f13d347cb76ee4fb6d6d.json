Immutability is the practice of replacing the current image with a brand new one, rather than updating it incrementally.

Furthermore, you can rollback to the previous image if the new one doesn't work - this is much more difficult if you are applying incremental changes to the same image. This ties directly into the concept of declarative configuration. Kubernetes itself manages changes to its state in a declarative fashion - each new desired state is declared concretely. Changes are not implied imperatively. Finally, Kubernetes manages this declared state continuously. If the actual state is different from the desired state, k8s will take action to create the desired state.

There are specific \"gotchas\" if you are using vendor managed services (e.g., AWS DynamoDB), but for the most part, Kubernetes is able to abstract components like load balancers and storage within different clouds. `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Bonus material:`}</strong>{` although not in this book, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/\"\n      }}>{`GCP Anthos`}</a>{` takes this idea one step further. Anthos provides a single pane of glass to manage a Kubernetes cluster or clusters that can span multiple clouds as well as on-prem. This gives companies a highly abstracted viewpoint for application development and operations. It also gives the business a clear road map for cloud migration, multi-cloud HA/DR capabilities, and more.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Lastly, k8s achieves efficiency by colocating applications on the same machine without impacting the applications themselves. This means that more work can be done by fewer machines. This results in direct economic benefits, but also allows for new development methodologies. Rather than scaling testing environments at the VM level, a single cluster can support the entire testing environment. This makes it possible to test every single commit or pull request, every time, throughout your entire stack. This efficiency and thoroughness feeds directly back into developer productivity and velocity. `}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2>{`Chapter 2: Creating and Running Containers`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md\"\n      }}>{`Docker image format`}</a>{` for containers is the de facto standard. It is composed of a series of root filesystem layers, one on top of another. Each layer adds, removes, or modifies the preceding layer in the filesystem. In practice, it looks something like this:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Container A: base operating system only`}\n        <ul parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Container B: build upon #A, by adding Ruby v2.1.10`}\n            <ul parentName=\"li\">\n              <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Container D: build upon #B by adding Rails v4.2.6`}</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Container C: build upon #A, by adding Golang v1.6 `}</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`The layering of these filesystems can result in extensive directed acyclic graphs that encompass a multitude of container images. It is worth noting that there is a counter-intuitive problem regarding the layering of filesystems. Deleting a file in a newer layer does not remove it from the preceding layers. This means that passwords/secrets should `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`never`}</strong>{` be baked into images because they will still exist and be accessible to anyone with the right tools. Piggybacking on this idea, it's important to order your layers according to which layers are most likely to change; these layers should be \"at the top\" or the newest of all layers. In the example above, if Container A were to change often, Containers B, C, and D would each need to be re-built to incorporate the changes.  Beyond this, it is a best practice to keep your application containers as lean as possible. The smaller the container binary, the more efficiently they can be allocated on compute. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Docker provides the ability to limit the amount of resources used by a container by exposing the underlying `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html\"\n      }}>{`cgroup`}</a>{` technology provided by the Linux kernel. Flags like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--memory`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--memory-swap`}</inlineCode>{`, and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--cpu-shares`}</inlineCode>{` accomplish this. Setting these restrictions is important to ensure that colocated applications have fair and predictable access to compute resources.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Whenever you build a new Docker image, it remains on your computer until explicitly deleted - even if you create a new image with the exact same tag/name.

Using commands like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl describe nodes`}</inlineCode>{`, you can see detailed information about all of the components of your cluster and what is running on them. The components that comprise Kubernetes are actually deployed using Kubernetes itself.

If you need access to a different namespace (like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kube-system`}</inlineCode>{`) you need to pass the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--namespace`}</inlineCode>{` flag.  `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Contexts`}</strong><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`You can use contexts to rewrite default configurations. For example, you can the default namespace or even the k8s cluster that you are managing. Contexts are usually stored in a configuration file at `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$HOME/.kube/config`}</inlineCode>{`. By defining and using different contexts, you can save yourself from having to explicitly type a lot of parameters and values.   `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Viewing Kubernetes API Objects`}</strong><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`Everything within Kubernetes is defined by a RESTful schema. Each k8s object exists at a unique HTTP path (e.g., https://galens-cluster/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/galens-pod) and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubectl`}</inlineCode>{` works by sending HTTP requests to those endpoints. In RESTful fashion, the most basic command for viewing objects is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`get`}</inlineCode>{`. You can use this to get all of a resource type or a specific object. You can add the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`-o wide`}</inlineCode>{` flag to have the output include more information on longer lines, as well as `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`-o json`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`-o yaml`}</inlineCode>{`. A particularly useful flag is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`--no-headers`}</inlineCode>{`. This skips the header at the beginning of a human-readable table and makes it very easy to pipe the output into other Unix commands. It is also very common to need to retrieve a specific field from the object. `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`kubectl`}</inlineCode>{` uses the JSONPath query language to select fields from the returned object. For example, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl get pods galens-pod -o jsonpath --template={.status.podIP}`}</inlineCode>{` would return the IP address of the Pod. Finally, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl describe <resource-name> <obj-name>`}</inlineCode>{` provides rich, multiline, human-readable information about an object, as well as any other related objects and events. `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Creating, Updating, and Destroying Kubernetes Objects`}</strong><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`Most of the time, k8s objects are created from a template file (YAML or JSON) using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl apply -f galens-object.yaml`}</inlineCode>{`. Similarly, any changes to the object's template are applied using the same command. You can use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl edit <resource-name> <obj-name>`}</inlineCode>{` to modify objects inplace. You can use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl delete -f galens-object.yaml`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`$ kubectl delete <resource-name> <obj-name>`}</inlineCode>{`, but `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Kubernetes will not ask for confirmation before deleting the resource`}</strong>{` - be careful!  `}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Labeling and Annotating Objects`}</strong><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`Labels and annotations are key-value pairs that can be used in various ways within Kubernetes.
