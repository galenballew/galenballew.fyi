This application was developed in a Summer 2016 project at the
[Mathematical Computing Laboratory](http://mcl.math.uic.edu/) at
[UIC](http://uic.edu/). It shows the hyperbolic space \\(S_3\\) projected into 3 dimensions. This Unity build was then made VR capable for peripherals like the Oculus Rift.  
This project was completed under the guidance and mentorship of [Professor David Dumas](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~ddumas/PML/). If you are interested in the mathematics of projective measured laminations, you can read about Professor Dumas' work [here.](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~ddumas/PML/)
